\section{Future}

integration as a "migration platform" in a framework that does request routing,
adaptive data placement (derecho?)

designing data structrues with migration in mind: "sub-trees" or independent
components usable separately

allocation: can be done with atomics, since they'll have little contention


\section{Conclusion}
What we did, what it does, \cite{kalia2016fasst} what it doesn't do. What are the things that our
proof of concept proves?

An async Slope API: This will be RDMA not just for cold, raw data, but RDMA for
objects.
