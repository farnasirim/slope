\section{Programming model}
\label{sec:platform}

\TODO{figure for per core memory and how threads interact with them?}

Applications have to call into Slope to initiate and carry on the
migration operations. Since Slope requires intimate access to the application
memory, we need to choose a low level platform with first class support for
memory management.

We have chosen C++ as the platform to implement Slope, mainly because we need
to directly access process memory and manage the way it is allocated and used.
Whether or not these limitations can be eliminated, for example by using Slope
as a service or like a sidecar process, as opposed to a library are future
research directions.

\subsection{A section on how useful the programming model is}
E.g. what data structures can be used naturally in this model
Moved here from evaluation section
\subsection{Multi-threading support}


\subsection{Local memory layout}
Before we can discuss the main components of Slope, we need to discuss how
memory is managed in each application instance which uses Slope. Similar to
RAMP \cite{memon2018ramp}, each program instance a
large \TODO{How do you choose the size? Equal to physical memory would be too large.} \TODO{elaborate how large is practical and why. Required for a future section} (e.g. equal to the machine's physical memory size) continuous part
of its virtual memory address space, starting at the same virtual address
on every machine, to be used by Slope.
This is done at program construction
time (i.e. before \texttt{main()}) and we will refer to this section of the virtual
address space the migratable memory or Slope memory. Note that mappings for
these pages are not yet generated and therefore the size of the Slope memory
region can be expanded to the whole 64 bits of address on current machines.
We will manage the Slope memory by 4KB page granularity as this is the
smallest unit of control for setting the protection of memory mappings.
We do not use \TODO{discuss why you do not need contiguous physical memory}
hugepages or contiguous physical memory as the former results in
loss of granularity and the latter needs to be done from inside the kernel and
typically at boot time before memory fragmentation gets in the way.

    Notice how Slope memory is at the same location in the virtual address
    space of the program on each node. It also has the same size and
    page boundaries on all machines. Also note how
    the 4KB pages from that region are not mapped to any physical memory pages
    yet.
}
\label{fig:localmemorymanagementphyslog}
\end{figure}

The placement of Slope memory in the application virtual address space is
central to the migration process. \TODO{Rewrite} If an object was wholly contained
in the Slope memory region on Machine 1, meaning it had no references to memory
outside
of that region and no references to any resources beyond the
scope of the application memory (E.g. a file descriptor), then if we moved all
of the memory belonging to that object to Machine 2, with the exception of
some house keeping tasks, for example memory allocation and deallocation, the
object would continue to ``work'' in its new residence.
This is the central
idea behind the migration of objects which is also used in \cite{memon2018ramp}
and all of the entities in Slope are designed
to support the execution of this task in a seamless manner and improve its
performance.

\subsection{fundamental requirement of fixed addresses}
\label{sec:fixedfundamental}
\TODO{Elaborate}
It is important to note that although strict and inflexible, the requirement of
placing Slope memory on the same virtual address in all machines is,
unfortunately, a fundamental requirement. \autoref{fig:localmemorymanagementfundamental}
shows an example of why this is the case. The implication is as long as the
application has any means of referencing the underlying virtual address of any
of its resources, its correct execution may end up depending on that address
staying the same at every point during the execution of the program. It would
be interesting to look into this issue and assess to what extent this can be
mitigated for example by allowing only ``named'' accesses to resources, similar
to how objects are accessed in Python (except the code boundary of calling into
external C functions). This way, we are effectively wrapping the application's
virtual address space in another layer of virtual addressing provided by the
language runtime.

\section{RDMA background}
RDMA programming model turns out to be a good fit for the networking
requirements of Slope. While we do benefit particularly from
offloading data plane processing from the source CPU to the network device,
RDMA networking can still be swapped out of Slope for other transports.

To send or receive data using kernel-based TCP, the application needs thread
is woken up multiple times by the kernel and has to call into the kernel
repeatedly, copying all of the payload between user and kernel space buffers.
RDMA networking prevents this by 1. allowing data to be sent/received without
the need to copy it from/to a temporary buffer, and 2. not calling into the
kernel on the critical path.

The following paragraphs introduce several concepts in RDMA
networking from control structures to Infiniband verbs. To keep this section
concise and on-point, we mostly describe the Infiniband features that are used
in Slope and skip low level details such as the role of various configuration
variables in the setup process.

An Infiniband subnet consists of hosts and switches that are interconnected
through their Infiniband adapters or Host Control Adapters (HCA).
Each subnet requires at least one Subnet Manager (SM) to function.
Infiniband switches or end hosts may play the role of SM. Multiple SMs
work in Active-Stand by mode. Among more complicated tasks such as managing
routing throughout the local subnet and possibly through the global Infiniband
Fabric, one of the responsibilities of the SM is assigning unique local
identifiers (\texttt{lid}s) to each port connected to the current subnet, not much
different from how a DHCP server assigns unique IP addresses to each device
that is connected to an IP network.

Queue pairs (QPs) can be thought of as being analogous to sockets in TCP/IP
networking. In our case we only use the reliable connected (RC) type of queue
pairs which guarantees reliability and in-order delivery.
A QP logically ``connects'' two hosts so that they can communicate using
RDMA verbs. Each of the two hosts independently creates a QP structure. The
QP is assigned a locally unique \texttt{qp\_num} to distinguish between the
QPs on the same host. The two QP structures then have to be introduced to
each other by transitioning them through multiple states, namely init, ready to
receive, and ready to send.

At certain points during these transition, each
QP end needs to know about the \texttt{lid} of the remote Infiniband port to
be able to identify and reach that port through the subnet. Naturally the
remote \texttt{qp\_num} has to be known for each QP end to be able to
distinguish and correctly select the target QP end's \texttt{qp\_num}.
Applications need to improvise their own methods of exchanging these two
pieces of information, typically called the out of band rendezvous and ready to
send protocols. We use memcached for this where every participating machine
registers the \texttt{lid} and \texttt{qp\_num} corresponding to each of its
QPs, alongside the intended remote node of this QP under that machine's key.
The number of machines and their registration keys
are known at the execution time of the program by all instances. After
publishing their information each machine goes through the keys corresponding
to other servers and blocks until finding their QP information in memcached.
After that each server $S$ selects the QPs whose intended remote node equals
$S$ and with the \texttt{lid} and \texttt{qp\_num} of that QP at hand, it
transitions the QP through the required states to make it ready to use. This
only happens at the initialization of the cluster after which we never use
the memcached instance again.

From this point on, each machine can use any of its QPs to exchange data with
the other end of the QP through the use of RDMA verbs. The QP APIs are
asynchronous, meaning the application calls into the Infiniband library to
``posts'' operations to the QPs, and ``poll'' the completion of certain events
such as the completion of a send request.

To send data using the RDMA SEND verb, the application needs to ``post'' one
or more send Work Requests (WRs) to the send queue of a QP. Among other fields
to control its behavior, a WR is consisted of one or more
continuous memory ranges that need to be sent through a QP. Each of these
is called a Scatter-Gatter Element (SGE). However the network device must be
able to access the memory pages that the SGEs point to through their physical
addresses, and those physical addresses must not change throughout the time
that the SEND is in progress. To make sure that is the case, the addresses
that underlie the SGEs must be subsets of Memory Regions (MRs) that we
explicitly register with the Infiniband library. Creating an MR from a set of
continuous memory pages will pin them in memory until the MR is
deregistered. To process the SEND request, the network device might reference
addresses from MRs that the SGEs point to, until that particular WR is
processed which means we are not allowed to write to those regions during
the time SEND is being processed. By default, a successful SEND request will
create a CQEs upon completion. The application can be notified of the completion
of the SEND WR by polling the CQ that is associated with the QP. After receiving
the completion, the application is free to deregister and/or write to the
memory under the MR.

For a SEND to succeed, the destination must have previously posted a suitable
RECV request to the Receive Queue of its end of the QP. Similar to the case with SENDs,
a RECV request takes the form of one or more receive WRs each of which
consists of multiple SGEs, which point to local memory that is pinned using
MRs. At the receiver, this will result in the data from the SGEs of the incoming
SEND to be written by the network device to the memory addresses that the
receive WR specifies through its SGEs.

Together, SEND and RECV are called two-sided verbs, meaning they require
intervention from both the sender and the receiver. In contrast, the one-sided
READ and WRITE verbs completely bypass the remote machine's processor and do not
produce entries in the CQs of the remote machine. To
issue a READ or WRITE, the caller must first pass SGEs referring to local memory
from which data will be READ, or to which data will be written, respectively.
In each of the above we must also specify an address in the remote machine
as the source for READ or the destination for WRITE. This address is in
the virtual address space of the remote machine, and must be contained in an
MR. The caller also needs the know the remote key (\texttt{rkey}) of the target
MR in the remote machine. Similar to the case with \texttt{lid} and
\texttt{qp\_num}, the application has to arrange for the \texttt{rkey} to be
transferred to the caller before it can call one sided VERBS. However with the
QPs now established, we do not necessarily need to rely on an out of band
communication mechanism to hand off \texttt{rkey}s as they can be sent using
RDMA SEND and RECV verbs.

We also use a variant of WRITE called ``WRITE with immediate values'', which
differs to a WRITE in that it generates a completion in the CQ of the
remote QP.

To know about which operations have been completed, applications must poll the
Completion Queue (CQ) structure.
Each QP is associated with one CQ. Applications may decide that some of their
QPs share a single CQ to reduce the number of separate structures that they
have to poll. As a result of polling the CQ, the application is handed
Completion Queue Entries (CQEs) which reveal the source of the completion.


\section{Architecture of Slope}
At a high level, Slope consists of \TODO{Update to quickly introduce} a control plane, a data plane,
a specialized distributed memory management
scheme/implementation, and a migration protocol
built on top
of the above. We have implemented the control plane and the data plane using
RDMA over Infiniband because of how well the benefits of RDMA networking
fit our problem specifications, but the APIs which the \TODO{two}
sub-systems expose are not dependent on how RDMA works or how their internals
are implemented.



\subsection{Control plane}
\TODO{control plane consists of functions such as distributed allocator,
migrate, etc.}
\ANGELA{RDMA too low level too soon Provide table of the control plane operations. Describe at a high level the communications over the control plane, then say how this is done using the RDMA framework.}
Control plane provides an abstraction over which application instances can
execute migration operations and other side-tasks including distributed
memory management. For each operation that we support, we create a reliable
connected queue pair between each pair of machines, and pre-post to them
as many receive requests as we need to support concurrently. When a
machine pulls out a work completion from the completion queues assigned to
these queue pairs, a receive buffer is reposted to the corresponding queue to
make up for any other incoming requests, and a request flow starts during which
the two machines will go back and forth to carry out the operation. Although
the control plane can be practically replaced by any rpc framework, we do not
have much to gain from using Herd \cite{kalia2016designguidelines} or
FaSSt \cite{kalia2016fasst}, as the performance metrics in Slope are dominated mostly
by the performance of the data plane.

When using connected queue pairs, meta-data
from each queue has to exist on the device cache for any operations to be
carried out through that queue pair. As the number of queue pairs on each node
increases linearly with the number of nodes in the cluster when we connect the
QPs in a full-mesh manner, the performance of the application will collapse
after we pass a certain number of nodes in the cluster, which has
incentivized designs of RPC systems that use datagram queue pairs such as
\cite{kalia2019datacenter} and \cite{kalia2016fasst}, even though others such
as \cite{novakovic2019storm} have proposed hybrid one sided and two sided
schemes which scale well. We have not reached a point where we can directly
benefit from these optimizations as we are mostly throughput (data plane)
limited. Furthermore we use each queue pair repeatedly in short bursts after a
migration operation is triggered which avoids invalidating the ``active'' QP
meta-data from the cache during the migration. However the control plane
can be replaced entirely with any other RPC mechanism that achieves better
performance.

For co-ordination between machines (e.g. rendezvous protocol and transition
to ready to send state)
an out of band communication mechanism has to be used. We use memcached where 
every node registers its queue pair and memory region parameters and
information and waits to receive the same information from its peers. This
phase only runs early in the program and does not have an effect on the
performance of the system after the initialization is finished, at which point
we no longer need the memcached server.

\subsection{Data plane}

\ANGELA{not clear pre-filling vs transfer}
The data plane is used to transfer the contents of a section of the Slope
memory to the same section in another node. As far as the data plane is
concerned, this is done in two major steps. Prefilling is done first, during
which the data plane will fill the corresponding addresses of the
Slope memory in a remote node from the same address in the current node, with
relaxed consistency requirements. Transfer operation follows shortly, during
which we ensure the contents of the above memory section in the source are
replicated to the same virtual addresses on the remote node. Prefilling is done
in 4KB page granularity, while transfer can be done in larger units, depending
on the contiguity of the memory section that is being transferred.

Combining the above with other control mechanisms in the migration protocol, we
ensure that the data which underlies an object is correctly transferred to the
remote node after a migration. Optimistically, the transfer operation uses some
of the data that is already replicated to the remote node during the prefill
phase. Some of the prefilled data must be invalidated due to writes between the
prefill and the transfer phases. The participants need to correctly identify
the pages whose contents need to be invalidated to benefit from the performance
gain, while doing a correct transfer. This will be discussed in detail in
\autoref{sec:migrationprotocol}.

\subsection{Distributed memory management}

\subsection{Migration protocol}
\label{sec:migrationprotocol}
We observe the lifetime of a migratable data structure from the point it is
created until after we finish migrating it to another node. Throughout the
lifetime of the object and during the migration process, there are certain
conditions that need to be satisfied by the application for the migration
operation to finish correctly. As discussed later in this section,
in many of these cases, forcing the application to satisfy low level conditions
cannot be completely achieved by the library and the responsibility of
conforming to these conditions will be left to the application.

\autoref{fig:migrationprotocol} outlines the migration protocol and the role
of Slope at different stages during the above timeline.

\begin{figure}[tp]

\ensurepdffromsvg{migration-protocol.drawio}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{migration-protocol.drawio}
\caption{
    Slope migration protocol starting from object creation. Time progresses
    downwards.
}
\label{fig:migrationprotocol}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Object creation}
During this phase the source machine calls into the Slope library multiple
times, based on how many times memory allocation and deallocation is required.

\paragraph{Source} creates a migratable object. Let us call this object
the target object. Up until the point that
the source initiates the migration, all of the memory allocations of the target object
must happen through
Slope's custom memory allocator through allocation contexts as discussed in
\TODO{must discuss contexts} \autoref{sec:platform}.
The application must satisfy the memory allocation requirements discussed in
\TODO{briefly mention here, elaborate there, so reader has a sense of limitations}
\autoref{subsec:trackallocations} to make sure Slope correctly keeps track of the
memory that each object references. \TODO{Namely...}

After the object is created the program will call the \texttt{run()} method
of the object, which may result in further calls to the memory allocator as
the object might need to allocate memory to process its incoming requests or
carry out the calls to its member functions. These new allocations will be
correctly picked up by Slope allocator given that allocation contexts are used
as discussed in \autoref{subsec:trackallocations}, meaning at any point in time we
know which memory pages belong to the target object.

\subsubsection{Migration initiation}
The application logic decides that the target object must be migrated from the
source machine to the destination. This might happen because the source machine
is balancing out its load by offloading the object to the destination or because
this particular object will benefit from running on the destination machine
by being local to resources that are available there.

This is the first time that the destination
machine will need to know about the properties of the target object. Had the
source machine not initiated the migration, the destination machine would have
stayed unaware of the existence of this object.

\paragraph{Source}
initiates the migration by calling into Slope. From this point
on, the application instance on the source machine is neither allowed to
cause any memory to be allocated to the target object, nor can it deallocate any memory that
this object references. Each of these can result from calling member functions
of the target object which either deallocate Slope memory previously held by the
object, or create Slope memory allocation contexts from the object and
use them to allocate Slope memory for the object.

This means the underlying Slope memory owned by this object is now
fixed. The application can continue to read or write to the memory that the
object already owns, until further on in the process when it receives a
notification from the Slope library. This notification signals that source
machine no longer owns the object, prohibiting this machine from any
interaction with the target object, including reading from or writing to its
memory. This will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

Slope posts a send request to the QP that is shared
between the source and the destination, initiating the migration.
With this request, the source will include $n$ the total number of
memory pages that the target object references. Note that Slope requires the
memory pages owned by the target object to stay the same during the migration
process after a call which initiates the migration, which means $n$ will be
constant throughout the process.

\paragraph{Destination}
receives a migration request along with $n$, the number of memory pages that the
target object owns and therefore need to
be transferred. The destination then populates another QP shared with the source
with $n$ receive requests, each corresponding to one of the virtual memory pages
that underlie the target object. We switch to a different QP
to allow concurrent migrations to happen between pairs of nodes. The destination
then goes on to notify the source that it can receive the description of the $n$
pages. The destination needs to know the page addresses
to first create mappings for them and then pin them in physical memory so that their
physical address will stay the same throughout the migration, while the network
device writes to the pages by their physical address over DMA.

\paragraph{Source} receives the clear to send from the destination and sends the starting address
of each of the $n$ pages to the destination. 

\paragraph{Destination} waits for $n$ page addresses, and for each one of them, pins the
corresponding page in physical memory, so that the addresses that underlie the
target object can be used in RDMA read and write verbs. Notice how
``pro-active'' strategies which do not require knowledge of the page addresses
will not work, as pinning the
whole Slope memory in the physical memory will in the worst case, exhaust the
available physical memory on some nodes, and in the best case, result in large
amounts of wasted physical memory space. When the $n$ pages are pinned
and are ready to be the target of the RDMA verbs, the destination responds back,
signaling that it has pinned all of the required pages.

\subsubsection{Prefill}
The goal of the prefill phase is to warm up the destination machine's memory to
minimize the window of time during which none of the two participating machines
own the target object. No machine can read from or write to the object during
that time. Therefore a long window without no owners means a long throughput
and latency hiccup as the application does not make any progress.

During the prefill phase we copy the target object to the destination over RDMA.
What makes it different from simply transferring the contents of memory is that
during the prefill operation, the source is still allowed to write to
any location in the target object memory,
despite not having permission to change the memory layout of the object
in any way by allocating or deallocating memory. We optimistically do the above
transfer knowing that some of the pages might need to be retransferred as they
are written to by the source machine after they are sent to the destination.
We will refer to these pages as dirty pages. While pages can be
dirtied, we go through the prefill phase, hoping that one of the
machines (namely the source machine) will be able to partially function during
this phase, while dirtying a small percentage of the pages.

\paragraph{Source} will need to loop through the memory pages of the target
object to prepare them to be read safely by the network device. It will then
need to use RDMA WRITE to send them to the destination, but before it is ready
to go through these, it must put in place the means to detect the pages that
are dirtied. A page will be dirtied when a write takes place in it, after
it is sent to the destination.

\subparagraph{Dirty page detection:}
This will be done using memory mapping protections and manually
handling signals that
are raised as a consequence of accesses to the protected memory pages.

First, the source overrides the default behavior of handling the
\texttt{SIGSEGV} signal using a call to
\texttt{sigaction}, to prevent the program from terminating on invalid memory
references. It is important to keep in mind that \texttt{SIGSEGV} is delivered
to the \emph{same} thread whose current instruction reads or writes memory
from a page that does not have the required permissions.

To synchronize the access to the pages of the target object,
we set the protection flags of each page to \texttt{PROT\_READ} before sending
it over RDMA. This prevents any writes from happening while RDMA WRITE
is in progress. These writes will result in a \texttt{SIGSEGV} signal being
raised because of an invalid memory reference, and the thread will start
executing our custom \texttt{SIGSEGV} handler.

Inside the signal handler, we make note of the address the access
to which caused the signal to be raised. This can be found in the
\texttt{si\_addr} field from the
\texttt{struct {*}siginfo\_t} which is passed to the handler.
Assuming this is an address in a
page that the target object owns, we mark the page containing the address as
dirty. In the simplest case, the RDMA WRITE corresponding to this page has
previously finished. We update the protection flags of this page back
to \texttt{PROT\_READ | PROT\_WRITE}
to allow further writes to the addresses in this page to succeed.

Otherwise the RDMA WRITE is still in progress in which case we need to be
more careful. In this case we need to wait for the
RDMA WRITE to finish before adding the \texttt{PROT\_WRITE} permission flag to
the page. In our
implementation we use a conditioned shared mutex where the thread which carries
out the RDMA operations is the writer and the threads that may call into the
signal handler are potential readers. As a result, each thread will will block
inside the signal handler until
the address to which they are trying to write acquires the correct permission.
\autoref{fig:dirtydetection} shows the execution flow of multiple threads
as each of them they fall into one of the above cases while Slope prefills a
page.

    deviates from its happy path.

\subparagraph{Preparation:} At this point in the process, the source still
has ownership over the target object memory. This means we need to coordinate
the access to these pages to prevent simultaneous reads and writes. To do this,
the source uses \texttt{mprotect} to make the current page read-only.
Semantically, the application is still allowed to write to the current page,
except when the RDMA SEND is happening.

\subparagraph{Send:} Each page is posted to a data plane QP shared between the
source and the sink, to be written to its corresponding virtual address in
destination over RDMA. Notice that we do not put the \texttt{PROT\_WRITE} permission
of the current page back after the RDMA SEND finishes, as we need to
detect any future writes which will dirty the page.
However we do set a condition variable which a threads running the signal
handler will check to know whether or not it is clear to put the \texttt{PROT\_WRITE} flag back.
At any point in time the clean pages will have their condition variable unset,
which is how we distinguish between the dirty and clean pages.

One by one, the source prepares and writes each page that the target object
owns, using the above procedures and keeps track of which of them is dirtied
over time.

\subsubsection{Transfer of ownership}

Contrary to case of detecting the pages that become dirty, which can be done
as described above, prevention of this phenomenon cannot be dealt with this way.
For example we may try to set \texttt{PROT\_NONE} permission on a page to
prevent accesses to it after we have started to send it to the destination.
The reason why this will not work will be discussed in the next section.


This cannot be correctly enforced by means such as setting the
\texttt{PROT\_NONE} on these pages. First, we might need multiple
\texttt{mprotect} calls to accomplish this if the pages are not adjacent,
meaning that we cannot assume the access to the object is ceased at a single
point in time. Furthermore even if we are able to take away the access to all
of the memory under the target object at once, if an application thread is
currently in the process of writing to the above memory, there is no right
action we can take from outside the application. For example this might have
been one write operation in the middle of a series of writes that the
application had been doing during the execution of a certain function. Therefore
from the standpoint of the library, we do not have enough information to deal
with cases similar to these, as aside from detecting the illegal writes, there
is no right action to take to remedy them.

\label{sec:transferownership}
At this point we are ready to turn the ownership over to the destination.
We also have to notify the application at the source to stop referencing the
target object for both reads and writes before we can proceed.

\paragraph{Destination} receives the completions for the prefill RDMA WRITEs.
That is because those WRITEs are done with immediate values which will results
in completion entries to be created for them. After the destination
receives the completion of the
last SEND, it will send a request back to the source, asking the source to
finally give up the ownership of the object.

\paragraph{Source} calls back to the application upon receiving the above
message to make sure the application will not reference the target object
for either of reads or writes after the callback returns. The application is
therefore responsible to block the callback an notifies all of its threads to
finish their ongoing operations on the target object. The application will
ideally transition to a ``pre-transfer'' mode after the initial migration
initiation. In this phase the application will try to do mostly read-only
accesses to avoid dirtying too many pages as this will cause the migration
to be done less efficiently with more pages that need to be transferred twice.
\autoref{sec:api} discusses this in detail and \autoref{sec:conform} will
discuss how this model fits naturally in C++ programs.

After the application clears the migration, effectively promising to never
reference the target object again, Slope will use the dirty
page tracking data to identify the dirty pages and send their addresses
to the destination. This message will also hand over the ownership
of the target object to the destination.

\paragraph{Destination} is notified that it has been given the ownership of
the object and is clear to start the \texttt{run()} method of the object,
but also needs to re-pull the dirty pages whose address is attached to the
request since the contents of these pages on the destination machine are
outdated.
Slope starts the above two processes concurrently. The destination machine
first sets
\texttt{PROT\_READ | PROT\_WRITE} access for the clean pages and
\texttt{PROT\_NONE} for the dirty pages. We put the dirty page addresses into 
a priority queue and fetch them from the source machine in order, giving
precedence to the pages which result in a
\texttt{SIGSEGV} being raised at the destination from an access by the
application. This means that the page has \texttt{PROT\_NONE} permission set and
is immediately required by an application thread. When the page is pulled using
RDMA READ, the page mapping flags will be updated to include read and write
permissions and any thread waiting for those pages can proceed. This is done
similar to how we do the dirty page detection on the source machine which was
discussed earlier.

\subsubsection{Post-transfer}
After the transfer is done, the state of the application will be
indistinguishable from a situation where we allocated the target object on
the destination machine from the start, if we deal with one final housekeeping
task.

\paragraph{Destination} will notify the source that it has READ all of the
dirty pages and that it no longer needs the destination to keep the
pre-transfer content of the object memory.

\paragraph{Source} will wait to receive the above message at which point it
safely \texttt{munmap}s the memory underlying the ``old'' target object. At
this point the state on the source looks as if the said object had never existed
there.


\section{Optimizations and Corner cases}
Multiple optimizations opportunities and housekeeping tasks have been omitted
from the earlier parts of this chapter. In this section we attend to these
subtle but important left out pieces.

\paragraph{C++ programming style to account for the prefill phase}
Writing programs that can both respect and leverage the prefill phases
described previously is important to keep code readable. We can encode the
conditions and requirements of the migration phase using C++ language features.
For example to represent the object after the prefill phase starts, we can
stick to using only a \texttt{const} reference to the target object,
forcing the user to use a discouraged \texttt{const\_cast} to be able to call
into the type's non-\texttt{const} methods.

\paragraph{Allocation strategies:} There are multiple ways to improve the memory
allocation performance. Since we need to allocate memory to objects in page
granularity, it is important to reduce fragmentation and wasted space,
otherwise the two will quickly pile up to decrease usable memory and increase
communication overhead. One optimization towards preventing this is to allocate
new memory from the page(s) that an object already owns instead of adding
new pages to an object every time \texttt{allocate()} is called on behalf of it.

Applications may want to provide their custom allocators on top of the Slope
allocator which allocates big regions from the shared address space. Given the
above note, using a general
allocator inside Slope would not be meaningful since internally, Slope's
allocator is optimizing towards a specific and object-local goal (namely
reducing the number of pages that an object owns) compared to the usual
global object-agnostic goals of generic allocators.

However it might
nevertheless be helpful to allow applications to pass in their own solutions
to the former problem. For that matter, general allocators' approaches can
be reused. For example we can pose the problem of ``fitting a new allocation
into one of the part-filled pages of the current object'' to a user supplied
allocator.

\paragraph{Deallocation:} Reasoning about and implementing deallocation must
be done with care since we have a local and a distributed level of memory
allocation in the system and multiple problems must be dealt with.

We need to handle deallocations both locally and globally. More concretely, we
need to correctly make note of the deallocated memory of each object, and also
keep track of the usage of each range lease such that they can be handed back
to their owners when they are no longer required.

Deallocation does not require an active context. Notice that requiring
an active context during deallocation is out of the question, since
deallocation could be happening in an object's destructor. This does not pose
a problem since we can keep an inverse map from memory allocations to
migratable objects and update it at each call to \texttt{allocate()}. We can
then use the inverse map to correctly attribute each deallocation with its
respective object and update the pages that underlie the object if necessary.

When a machine deallocates memory referenced by a migratable object, this
information needs to be sent back to the lease holder of the memory range in
which the deallocated memory falls. We do this off the critical path, such that
each meachine accumulates deallocated memories and sends them in batches to
the machines that they originally belonged ($i$th $\frac{1}{n}$ of the
shared address space originally belongs to the $i$th machine), since the machine
on which the
deallocation happens does not have any information about
the actual lease owner of the embodying memory range. The original owner
of the memory range is then responsible to relay this information to the current
lease holder.

The timings of these requests do not pose a problem. That is
because while deallocations can happen globally, allocations from a memory range
happen only at the owner and the order in which we interleave the two types of
operations cannot result in double deallocation (since each object is owned by
exactly one machine) and double allocation (since all of the allocations happen
at the current node on unallocated memory). The lease holder can turn the lease
over to the original owner if it does not contain any allocated memory.

\paragraph{Optimizing communication over RDMA:} There is room to optimize
the RDMA communication further. In some steps during the migration, we
increase the smallest unit of communication from pages to continuous chunks
of memory, possibly spanning multiple pages. Similarly when calling for
READs/WRITEs on continuous chunks or pages, we chain together multiple
WR's and post them in a single request to decrease the number of times we
have to notify the network device using MMIO over the PCIe bus.

In the prefill phase, instead of sending the full list of dirty pages to the
destination so that it can prioritize which of them to READ first, we can
proactively choose one or a small number of the pages and WRITE them in
parallel to sending the dirty list to the destination to save half of an rtt
in latency and leverage the free bandwidth.
For example we can prevent one page fault on the destination
if the page in which the allocated object \emph{reference} lies is dirty and
the source WRITEs it proactively, since this page will generate the first
fault when an object is accessed.
