ramp: We make every data structure migratable in a blackbox fashion, without

is not backwards compatible with c++,

is susceptible to contention in allocating memory regions

uses stateful allocators

changing the how memory allocators are generally used in C++ (e.g. STL)

We can use the allocators that have been previously developed, because we
conform to the c++ requirement of the allocators (operator== and operator!=,
resulting in the allocators being stateless).

(I hope) shorter in-between time when migrating
