%% SUMMARY OF FEATURES:
%%
%% All environments, commands, and options provided by the `ut-thesis'
%% class will be described below, at the point where they should appear
%% in the document.  See the file `ut-thesis.cls' for more details.
%%
%% To explicitly set the pagestyle of any blank page inserted with
%% \cleardoublepage, use one of \clearemptydoublepage,
%% \clearplaindoublepage, \clearthesisdoublepage, or
%% \clearstandarddoublepage (to use the style currently in effect).
%%
%% For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%% `longquotation' environments.


%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  - Default settings format a final copy (single-sided, normal
%%    margins, one-and-a-half-spaced with single-spaced notes).
%%  - For a rough copy (double-sided, normal margins, double-spaced,
%%    with the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use
%%    the `draft' option.
%%  - The default global line spacing can be changed with one of the
%%    options `singlespaced', `onehalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.
%%  - Footnotes and marginal notes are all single-spaced by default, but
%%    can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document
%%    by using the option `standardspacednotes'.
%%  - The size of the margins can be changed with one of the options:
%%     . `narrowmargins' (1 1/4" left, 3/4" others),
%%     . `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%%     . `widemargins' (1 1/4" all),
%%     . `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).
%%  - The pagestyle of "cleared" pages (empty pages inserted in
%%    two-sided documents to put the next page on the right-hand side)
%%    can be set with one of the options `cleardoublepagestyleempty',
%%    `cleardoublepagestyleplain', or `cleardoublepagestylestandard'.
%%  - Any other standard option for the `report' document class can be
%%    used to override the default or draft settings (such as `10pt',
%%    `11pt', `12pt'), and standard LaTeX packages can be used to
%%    further customize the layout and/or formatting of the document.

%% single, one-and-a-half, or double spaced (see the `setspace' package

%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.
%\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.

\begin{abstract}

%% *** Put your Abstract here. ***
    Load balance and data locality are important performance factors
    \ANGELA{Emphasize *distributed* software systems in particular, since you are focused on moving data structures across machines.}
    \CHECK{emphasized distributed applications} in distributed software systems where managing the data or carrying
    out the computations on a single machine becomes infeasible.
    The ability to move in-memory resources across machines can directly impact the
    above metrics in applications. That said, altering the designs of
    data~structures and algorithms to make them migratable is not only
    a non-trivial task but also can incur
    performance penalties resulting from overheads like serialization and
    de-serialization and increased CPU usage.

    In this thesis we introduce Slope, a plugable solution for making
    data~structures and their associated operations migratable. On a higher
    level this allows distributed applications to make their self-contained
    units of computation migratable to achieve data locality and load balance.
    Our approach eliminates data serialization and can be applied to existing
    systems. We use RDMA as the transport as it closely fits the requirements of Slope.
    We identify key metrics for our migration operation and evaluate Slope on
    microbenchmarks to measure the performance of each sub-system, and on full
    distributed applications to discuss end-to-end efficiency.

\end{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.  Use \cleardoublepage
%% for anything that you want to appear on a right-hand page.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed -- just a paragraph
%% formatted flush right (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\begin{dedication}
%% *** Put your Dedication here. ***
%\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% uncomment the following line.
%\newpage  % separate pages for dedication and acknowledgements

%% Alternatively, if you leave both on the same page, it is probably a
%% good idea to add a bit of extra vertical space in between the two --
%% for example, as follows (adjust as desired).
%\vspace{.5in}  % vertical space between dedication and acknowledgements

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\begin{acknowledgements}
    Thank you Angela for never yelling at a very yellable me.

    \TODO{thank Eric}
\end{acknowledgements}

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoffigures

%% You can add commands here to generate any other material that belongs
%% in the head matter (for example, List of Plates, Index of Symbols, or
%% List of Appendices).

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep     %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files.     %%
%%  Each chapter file should start with "\chapter{ChapterName}".      %%
%%  Note that using `\include' instead of `\input' will make each     %%
%%  chapter start on a new page, and allow you to format only parts   %%
%%  of your thesis at a time by using `\includeonly'.                 %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% *** Include chapter files here. ***

\include{introduction}
\include{design}
\include{evaluation}
\include{related}
\include{discussionfuture}


%% This adds a line for the Bibliography in the Table of Contents.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
%% *** Set the bibliography style. ***
%% (change according to your preference/requirements)
\bibliographystyle{plain}

%% *** Set the bibliography file. ***
%% ("thesis.bib" by default; change as needed)
\bibliography{thesis}

%% *** NOTE ***
%% If you don't use bibliography files, comment out the previous line
%% and use \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.  (In that
%% case, you should probably put the bibliography in a separate file and
%% `\include' or `\input' it here).
