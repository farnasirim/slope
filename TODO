Based on the design guidelines paper:
    Multi queue optimization is useful: Avoid "binding" a fast cpu core to a slow NPU and use multiple qps
    Can we use their timer trick (client guesses the upper 4 bytes) that they use to get around the 8 byte limitation of the immediate value?

Allocation metadata (what which pages are owned by this object) must also be shipped with the object itself.

Variables that we have to be careful about:
dev_attrs.max_sge: 30
dev_attrs.max_sge_rd: 30
dev_attrs.max_qp_rd_atom: 16
dev_attrs.max_qp_init_rd_atom: 16
dev_attrs.max_srq_wr: 32767
dev_attrs.max_srq_sge: 31
dev_attrs.max_pkeys: 128



Make data structure implementations to see what's required/useful
distributed trie?

Do not compare to the ideal scenario, compare to what's currently possible/doable
